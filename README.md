# lockdown4point0
A *very* quick proof of concept for plotting covid19 exposure sites in Victoria, Australia, using DHHS exposure site data.

Uses data from data.gov.au to display suburb boundaries, and exposure site data pulled from the coronavirus.vic.gov.au site. Mashed together and visualised using Folium. 

Created because I found it hard to keep up with the list of exposure sites on https://www.coronavirus.vic.gov.au/exposure-sites. Using a map makes it much more accessible. 

TODO: Filter by date/time, improve geocoding, bus/train routes do not parse well, fix spelling mistakes in source data etc.
